## What is Rainbow?

Rainbow is a high-performance in-memory key-value store (KVS) for commodity multicore hardware running Linux.
State-of-art KVS servers are designed around specialized hardware capabilities such as RDMA and FPGAs on SmartNICs or around kernel-bypass networking such as DPDK.
The server is compatible with the Memcache binary protocol.
