## What is Rainbow?

Rainbow is a Memcached-compatible high-performance in-memory key-value store (KVS) for commodity multicore hardware running Linux. State-of-art KVS servers leverage specialized hardware capabilities such as RDMA and SmartNICs or kernel-bypass techniques such as DPDK. However, specialized solutions are often hard to program and, more importantly, more difficult and expensive to deploy.

Rainbow follows a partitioned design, which shards keyspace between CPU cores that own a slice of the DRAM. The system is designed to leverage commodity multiqueue NICs and Linux's XDP packet processing interface. The server splits request processing into two parts: (1) in-kernel request pre-processing using XDP to that determines the CPU core that owns request key and (2) userspace request processing. The benefit of Rainbow's design is that CPU cores work independently of each other.
